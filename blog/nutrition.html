                                    <p>Anecdotally, I've often heard that one can survive on a diet of purely potatoes
                                        and milk. Dubious, I decided to find out for myself. In considering the above, I
                                        became interested in the more general questions: given a set of nutritional
                                        constraints, how can one construct an optimal diet? And, can we identify
                                        'superfoods' that tend to appear in optimal diets?</p>
                                    <h2>Dataset</h2>
                                    <p>To answer these questions, we first need a dataset of foods and their nutritional
                                        properties. I found such a dataset on <a
                                            href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/trolukovich/nutritional-values-for-common-foods-and-products">kaggle</a>,
                                        originally sourced <a href="https://www.nutritionvalue.org/">here</a>. It
                                        contains 8789 foods and 75 nutritional features per 100g, including summary
                                        features (calories, protein, fat, carbohydrates, etc.), vitamins, minerals,
                                        amino acids, and fatty acids. To clean the dataset I removed a few useless
                                        columns (e.g. trans fat) and foods unlikely to realistically make up an adult's
                                        sdiet (e.g. babyfood, beverages, leavening agents). I noticed a significant
                                        fraction of foods were missing the full amino acid breakdown of their protein
                                        content; rather than fill these columns with, for example, the median value, I
                                        left these set to zero. In practice, I found the choice didn't significantly
                                        affect optimal diet results[^1].</p>
                                    <h2>Constraints</h2>
                                    <h2>Secondly, we need to establish the set of nutritional constraints. We can of
                                        course set whatever constraints we want but to get the 'healthiest' ones is
                                        harder than it sounds since nutrition is a controversial topic and
                                        scientifically the field is underdeveloped; specific nutritional requirements
                                        for individuals are a bit of a grey area[^2]. I used the US daily recommended
                                        allowances (male) as lower limits for most nutritional features and the European
                                        food safety authority tolerable upper intake levels as upper limits for vitamins
                                        and minerals. Below is the full list of constraints. Not all nutritional
                                        features have constraints, and some only have a lower or upper limit.
                                        Unconstrained nutritional features are not listed below.</h2>

                                    <p>I disregarded constraints on calories and food weight for now since these will be
                                        included as part of the optimization objective. Healthy humans typically need
                                        1950 &lt; calories (kcal) &lt; 2500 and eat 3 &lt; weight (lbs) &lt; 5 of food
                                        per day.</p>
                                    <h2>Optimization</h2>
                                    <p>Now we can start by considering the optimal diet. This can be formulated as a
                                        linear program (LP). In fact, this exact problem led John von Neumann to
                                        postulate the theory of duality for constrained optimization[^3]. In 1947,
                                        George Dantzig approached von Neumann at the RAND corporation with the problem
                                        of devising a diet that met a soldier's nutritional needs as cheaply as
                                        possible, writing down an LP. Von Neumann immediately said 'oh, that!', and
                                        proceeded to connect the problem to his minimax theorem for two person zero sum
                                        games, to Dantzig's amazement.</p>
                                    <p>The LP formulation of the optimal diet problem is as follows. Let $x$ be the
                                        vector of food weights in the diet in units of 100g, the optimization variable
                                        to be found. The nutritional constraints on $x$ can be summarized as $l &lt; Ax
                                        &lt; u$, where $l$ is the vector of lower bounds, $u$ upper bounds, and $A$ the
                                        matrix of constrained nutritional features. We have the additional constraint
                                        that $x &gt; 0$, since we can't un-eat foods. Of course, many diets $x$ can
                                        satisfy this set of linear nutrtional constraints so we need a criterion to
                                        decide which of these feasible diets is the best. We can do this by defining a
                                        cost function $c^Tx$ that assigns a 'cost' to each food in the diet. The optimal
                                        diet is then the one that minimizes the cost function while satisfying the
                                        nutritional constraints. But what should the 'cost' vector $c$ be?</p>
                                    <h2>There are a few options. We could define $c$ as the literal cost, the price of
                                        each food. Solving the resulting LP would find the cheapest diet that satisifes
                                        the nutritional constraints. This is pretty interesting, but unfortunately our
                                        dataset doesn't come with food prices -- they also presumably vary widely
                                        depending on where you live. The feasible options are minimizing weight (most
                                        mass efficient nutritional diet), calories (lowest calorie nutrtional diet), or
                                        both. With the original objectives of this article in mind, to get the best of
                                        both worlds I'm going to tradeoff between both of these objectives; at the
                                        extreme ends of the tradeoff we get the optimal diets for each objective. The LP
                                        is then:</h2>
                                    <p>Minimize $c^T\mathbf{x} + \gamma\mathcal{1}^T\mathbf{x}$</p>
                                    <h2>subject to $l \leq A\mathbf{x} \leq u$
                                        $\mathbf{x} \geq 0$</h2>
                                    <p>where $c$ is the vector of calories per 100g, the ones vector $\mathcal{1}$ is
                                        the vector of weights in units of 100g, and $\gamma$ is the tradeoff variable.
                                        Interestingly, note that since $\mathbf{x} \geq 0$, the objective
                                        $\mathcal{1}^T\mathbf{x}$ is equivalent to the L1 norm $|\mathbf{x}|_1$, meaning
                                        the solution to the optimization problem will be sparse. The optimal diet will
                                        be composed of a few foods that are very efficient at satisfying the nutritional
                                        constraints.</p>
                                    <p>Before solving the problem, I want to explain why I chose to include calories as
                                        part of the objective function. Minimizing food weight makes sense, you don't
                                        want the nutritional diet to be a chore to eat (imagine eating 3kg of raw
                                        spinach), but calories are usually considered a nutritional requriement and
                                        could be included as a constraint instead of an objective. The reason is
                                        <strong>I am more interested in identifying specific foods that appear in many
                                            optimal diets rather than the diets themselves</strong>. Lower calorie
                                        intakes (not too low) are associated with good health outcomes and longevity. By
                                        including calories as part of the objective, the optimal diets are incentivized
                                        to include more low calorie 'superfoods'. Foods in the optimal diet that are
                                        robust to changes in the tradeoff parameter $\gamma$ must be particularly low
                                        calorie and nutritionally dense.

                                        potatoes and milk satisfy all of the nutritional constraints? The answer is
                                        emphatically ...</p>
                                    <p>[^1]: Amino acid nutritional requirements are often filled by dense complete
                                        protein sources like soy in both cases.
                                        [^2]: Particularly since digestive efficiency is very poorly understood, and
                                        varies widely between individuals. You could eat the 'optimal' nutritional diet
                                        on paper but only digest 70% of it, making it a suboptimal diet for you.
