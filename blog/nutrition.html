                            <hr>
                            <p>Anecdotally, I've often heard that one can survive on a diet of purely potatoes
                                and milk. Dubious, I decided to find out for myself. In considering the above, I
                                became interested in the more general questions: given a set of nutritional
                                constraints, how can one construct an optimal diet? And, can we identify
                                'superfoods' that tend to appear in optimal diets?</p>
                            <h2>Dataset</h2>
                            <p>To answer these questions, we first need a dataset of foods and their nutritional
                                properties. I found such a dataset on <a
                                    href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/trolukovich/nutritional-values-for-common-foods-and-products">kaggle</a>,
                                originally sourced <a href="https://www.nutritionvalue.org/">here</a>. It
                                contains 8789 foods and 75 nutritional features per 100g, including summary
                                features (calories, protein, fat, carbohydrates, etc.), vitamins, minerals,
                                amino acids, and fatty acids. To clean the dataset I removed a few useless
                                columns (e.g. trans fat) and foods unlikely to realistically make up an adult's
                                sdiet (e.g. babyfood, beverages, leavening agents). I noticed a significant
                                fraction of foods were missing the full amino acid breakdown of their protein
                                content; rather than fill these columns with, for example, the median value, I
                                left these set to zero. In practice, I found the choice didn't significantly
                                affect optimal diet results <a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>.</p>

                            <h2>Constraints</h2>
                                <p>Secondly, we need to establish the set of nutritional constraints. We can of
                                    course set whatever constraints we want but to get the 'healthiest' ones is
                                    harder than it sounds since nutrition is a controversial topic and
                                    scientifically the field is underdeveloped; specific nutritional requirements
                                for individuals are a bit of a grey area <a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>. I used the US daily recommended
                                allowances (male) as lower limits for most nutritional features and the European
                                food safety authority tolerable upper intake levels as upper limits for vitamins
                                and minerals. Below is the full list of constraints. Not all nutritional
                                features have constraints, and some only have a lower or upper limit.
                                Unconstrained nutritional features are not listed below.</p>

                                <p>I disregarded constraints on calories and food weight for now since these will be
                                    included as part of the optimization objective. Healthy humans typically need
                                    1950 &lt; calories (kcal) &lt; 2500 and eat 3 &lt; weight (lbs) &lt; 5 of food
                                    per day.</p>
                                <h2>Optimization</h2>
                                <p>Now we can start by considering the optimal diet. This can be formulated as a
                                    linear program (LP). In fact, this exact problem led John von Neumann to
                                postulate the theory of duality for constrained optimization <a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a>. In 1947,
                                George Dantzig approached von Neumann at the RAND corporation with the problem
                                of devising a diet that met a soldier's nutritional needs as cheaply as
                                possible, writing down an LP. Von Neumann immediately said 'oh, that!', and
                                proceeded to connect the problem to his minimax theorem for two person zero sum
                                games, to Dantzig's amazement.</p>
                                <p>The LP formulation of the optimal diet problem is as follows. Let $x$ be the
                                    vector of food weights in the diet in units of 100g, the optimization variable
                                    to be found. The nutritional constraints on $x$ can be summarized as $l &lt; Ax
                                    &lt; u$, where $l$ is the vector of lower bounds, $u$ upper bounds, and $A$ the
                                    matrix of constrained nutritional features. We have the additional constraint
                                    that $x &gt; 0$, since we can't un-eat foods. Of course, many diets $x$ can
                                    satisfy this set of linear nutrtional constraints so we need a criterion to
                                    decide which of these feasible diets is the best. We can do this by defining a
                                    cost function $c^Tx$ that assigns a 'cost' to each food in the diet. The optimal
                                    diet is then the one that minimizes the cost function while satisfying the
                                    nutritional constraints. But what should the 'cost' vector $c$ be?</p>
                                <p>There are a few options. We could define $c$ as the literal cost, the price of
                                    each food. Solving the resulting LP would find the cheapest diet that satisifes
                                    the nutritional constraints. This is pretty interesting, but unfortunately our
                                    dataset doesn't come with food prices -- they also presumably vary widely
                                    depending on where you live. The feasible options are minimizing weight (most
                                    mass efficient nutritional diet), calories (lowest calorie nutrtional diet), or
                                    both. With the original objectives of this article in mind, to get the best of
                                    both worlds I'm going to tradeoff between both of these objectives; at the
                                    extreme ends of the tradeoff we get the optimal diets for each objective. The LP
                                    is then:</p>
                                    <hr>
                                    <p>Minimize &emsp; $c^T\mathbf{x} + \gamma\mathcal{1}^T\mathbf{x}$</p>
                                    <p>subject to &emsp; $l \leq A\mathbf{x} \leq u$, &ensp; $\mathbf{x} \geq 0$</p>
                                    <hr>
                                <p>where $c$ is the vector of calories per 100g, the ones vector $\mathcal{1}$ is
                                    the vector of weights in units of 100g, and $\gamma$ is the tradeoff variable.
                                    Interestingly, note that since $\mathbf{x} \geq 0$, the objective
                                    $\mathcal{1}^T\mathbf{x}$ is equivalent to the L1 norm $|\mathbf{x}|_1$, meaning
                                    the solution to the optimization problem will be sparse. The optimal diet will
                                    be composed of a few foods that are very efficient at satisfying the nutritional
                                    constraints.</p>
                                <p>Before solving the problem, I want to explain why I chose to include calories as
                                    part of the objective function. Minimizing food weight makes sense, you don't
                                    want the nutritional diet to be a chore to eat (imagine eating 3kg of raw
                                    spinach), but calories are usually considered a nutritional requriement and
                                    could be included as a constraint instead of an objective. The reason is
                                    <strong>I am more interested in identifying specific foods that appear in many
                                        optimal diets rather than the diets themselves</strong>. Lower calorie
                                    intakes (not too low) are associated with good health outcomes and longevity. By
                                    including calories as part of the objective, the optimal diets are incentivized
                                    to include more low calorie 'superfoods'. Foods in the optimal diet that are
                                    robust to changes in the tradeoff parameter $\gamma$ must be particularly low
                                    calorie and nutritionally dense.

                                <h2>Potatoes and Milk</h2>
                                <p>To return to the original inspiration for this article, can a diet of solely
                                    potatoes and milk satisfy all of the nutritional constraints? The answer, given the constraints
                                    above, is no. Technically, potatoes alone are nutritionally 'complete' in the sense that they have non-zero
                                    amounts of every constrained nutrient, however the ratio in which they manifest these nutrients doesn't fit the
                                    constraints
                                    for a healthy diet (e.g. potatoes are fairly high in sugars). Potatoes and milk are also far too low in vitamins E and
                                    K, meaning you would have to eat
                                    potentially lethal amounts to satisfy the constraints. Throwing in sweet potatoes helps, but still doesn't meet
                                    the constraint requirements. Here is the diet I used to test the potatoes + milk hypothesis: </p>

                                    <p>An interesting follow up question is: what is the smallest possible addition to this diet to make it nutritionally
                                        feasible?</p>
